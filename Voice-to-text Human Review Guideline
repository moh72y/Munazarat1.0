Voice-To-Text Human Review Guideline
Each AI transcribed debate will undergo a three-phases review process. The first review will be by listening to and reviewing the debate script at the same time. While the second and third reviews will require only reading the previous review to make sure that the script is understandable to the reader and is clean from mistakes. 

1)	First Review 
•	Go to the link of Fenek AI that corresponds to your assigned debates as shown in the Master Google Sheet.
•	Download the TXT file from Fenek AI website and import it to a Word document.
•	Add table in the beginning of the file as shown in figure 1 that corresponds to the four mistakes categories we identified.

•	Use the same highlight colors in the box in Figure 1 to label the adjustments during review 1 which are as follows:
o	Red color: Extra words that should be deleted.
o	Yellow color: Missing words that were added.
o	Green color: Words are misspelled and have been edited.
o	Blue color: English words that were misspelled and have been edited.
•	Open the YouTube video that corresponds to the debate which you are assigned to review. 
•	Start editing while listening to the debate on the Word document and highlight all the needed adjustments.
•	At the beginning of each speech add the following information (Speaker’s order, opposition or proposition, and the gender).
•	Inside each speech separate the letter “و” when it is used as a linking letter from all the words after it
•	After you are done with editing calculate the occurrence of every label and add them to the schedule that you created in the beginning (Note: if the same mistake happened more than once we count it as one mistake)
•	Upload the file in the Google Drive named “RM (Number of the debate)” 
•	Duplicate the MS Word file, clear all the highlights and remove the table, then upload this file to the designated Google drive folder and name it “R (Number of the debate)”

2)	Second Review
•	Obtain the assigned debate file from Google Drive and create a new duplicated file to edit the script.
•	Read the script without listening to the YouTube video, unless needed.
•	Check for any mistakes (grammatical, comprehension) and adjust them.
•	Check the separation of the letter “و”.

3)	Third Review
•	Repeat the same process in the second review.
•	Re-do the paragraph division while reading the text to enhance sentence comprehension for readers.
